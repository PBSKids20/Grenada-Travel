      <h2>Colonization of Grenada</h2>
      <p>Colonization started when Christopher Columbus arrived on his third trip to the "new-world" in 1498. Grenada remained uncolonized for more than 100 years after its discovery; early English efforts to settle the island were unsuccessful. In 1650, a French company founded by Cardinal Richelieu purchased Grenada from the English and established a small settlement.</p>
